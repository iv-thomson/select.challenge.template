This is a repo for a VUEJS interview live coding exercise.

This repo contains the dropdown-element component. The objective is to make this component more extendable.

Requirements:

- We need to be able to pass an optional 'sublabel' to every option of the component

- We need to be able to pass an optional icon to every option of the component. The icon can be either on the left or on the right of the text.

- We need to be able to pass a color coded text to the every option of the component. The text should be green if number is greater or equal than 0 and red if number is less than 0.
