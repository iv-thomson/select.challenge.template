This is a repo for a VUEJS interview live coding exercise.

## The objective

This repo contains the dropdown-element component. The objective is to make this component more extendable.

Requirements:

#### We need to be able to pass an optional 'sublabel' to every option of the component

<img src="./assets/example-1.png?raw=true" alt="example-1" width="200px" />  

#### We need to be able to pass an optional icon to every option of the component. The icon can be either on the left or on the right of the text.
  
<img src="./assets/example-2.png?raw=true" alt="example-1" width="200px" />  


#### We need to be able to pass a color coded text to the every option of the component. The text should be green if number is greater or equal than 0 and red if number is less than 0.

<img src="./assets/example-3.png?raw=true" alt="example-1" width="200px" />
